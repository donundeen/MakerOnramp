# TODO Items

- make a tracker that can show the last update time for each skill tree item document



- to make the documentation we're making useful as quickly as possible, we need to:
-- need direct URL to individual skill tree item documentation
-- list of skill tree items that have documentation status "publish" - for students to access

- student page with
-- their "collected" items, w links to their documentation/evidence decks

- refactor
-- make things more object-oriented
-- organized client side, html, css, into reasonable groupings
-- templating system for making html easier to manage
-- name files in sensible ways so they are easy to find
--- server-side vs client-side javascript, for eg.

- then, creating a model for "projects"



- Google Sheets CRUD operations
-- create
-- read
-- update
-- delete
